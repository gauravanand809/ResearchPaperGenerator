Using Indian English spellings and including ₹ for financial data.

Key Requirements:
- All sections must be present with expanded content
- 100+ citations (minimum 30 Indian studies)
- Use clear, professional academic language
- Include detailed Indian case studies and examples
- Convert measurements to metric units
- Use ₹ for currency values

## Abstract (300-500 words)
Follow this exact structure:
1. Context: 1-2 sentences establishing importance
2. Gap: Clearly state what's missing in current research
3. Objective: Precise statement of study goals  
4. Methods: Concise description of approach
5. Key Findings: 2-3 most significant results
6. Implications: How findings advance the field

Example:
"Hydrogen production from agricultural residues offers sustainable energy solutions. Current methods focus on common crops, neglecting region-specific byproducts. This study examines H₂ yield from mustard, arhar and tori residues via dark fermentation. Results show mustard residues yield 2.8 mol H₂/mol glucose, with co-fermentation improving efficiency by 15%. These findings demonstrate the potential of underutilized regional crops for bioenergy."
